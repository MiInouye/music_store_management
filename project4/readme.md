Project 4 - music_store_management - Java SE 17 jdk 17.0.2

Documentation of development for Project 4: We definitely struggled with this project, mainly with making choices that we then realized later could have been done better with patterns. We realized there were many things we could have made better, but didn't have the time to make better afterwards.
Assumptions: We didn't really make many different assumptions about the project but we did add some small things such as a print for the guitar kit parts once a guitar kit was made and sold. Small extra details were added but nothing special.
Project Layout: Stayed pretty true to the UML Diagram, nothing special to note here.
